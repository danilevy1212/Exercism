## Forethought

These exercises are designed for learning. Try to come up with the code that will satisfy the tests on your own first or you'll just be spoiling yourself! If you need to lookup something, use the links I left in the next section or look for info that relates to "how" to build the code of your particular solution. Again, try not to spoil yourself.
